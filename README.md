# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my journey of solving **one DSA problem every day**.  
The goal is to strengthen my **problem-solving**, **coding efficiency**, and **algorithmic thinking** through consistent practice.

> ⚠️ Had an issue and missed about 1–2 weeks,  
> but I’m continuing from **Day 18** — no resets, just progress.
