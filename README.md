# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my journey of solving **one DSA problem every day**.  
The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving, coding efficiency, and algorithmic thinking through consistent practice.

📅 **Started on:** 23rd September 2025  
🔥 **Current Streak:** 3 days

## 📌 Structure
Problems are organized into topic-based folders:
- `arrays/`
- `linked-lists/`
- `stacks/`
- `queues/`
- `trees/`
- `graphs/`
- `sorting/`
- `searching/`
- `dynamic-programming/`
- `misc/`

Each file contains:
1. The problem statement (in comments).
2. The solution in Python.
3. Explanations or notes (where necessary).
